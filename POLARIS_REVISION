Vendored skills (upstream-managed copies)
- Polaris:
  - skills/ufabric-code-review/ (copied into `./.agents/skills/`, `./.agent/skills/`, `./.claude/skills/`)
- Third-party: none

Sync procedure (copy + sync)
1) Choose a Polaris revision (tag/SHA) to sync from.
2) Re-copy the skill directories from Polaris into this repo:
   - From Polaris: `skills/ufabric-code-review/`
   - To this repo:
     - `./.agents/skills/ufabric-code-review/`
     - `./.agent/skills/ufabric-code-review/`
     - `./.claude/skills/ufabric-code-review/`
3) Update this file with the chosen Polaris revision and the copy date.
4) Treat the vendored copies as upstream-managed: do not local-edit; change Polaris first, then re-copy.
