# Publications and Material

uFabric publishes and shares materials once they reach an appropriate level of clarity and maturity.

These may include:

- technical notes
- working papers
- documented prototypes
- open repositories
- methodological guides

Some research activities remain private during early exploration phases to ensure responsible evaluation before publication.
