# Mission

Our mission is to contribute to the enhancement of human capabilities through artificial intelligence, by means of research, infrastructure, and practices that place humans at the center.

We seek to make the use of AI understandable, evaluable, and governable, avoiding purely instrumental or extractive approaches.

Our principles:

- **human-first**  
AI is a tool to support human judgment and creativity, not a replacement for it.
- **technical responsibility**  
Security, privacy, and traceability are baseline requirements, not optional features.
- **evidence and evaluation**  
We prioritize observable results over speculative promises.
- **openness and documentation**  
Knowledge grows when it is shared clearly and responsibly.
- **sovereignty and context**  
Technical decisions must consider institutional, cultural, and local realities.
