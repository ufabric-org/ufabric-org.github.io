# Research

uFabric organizes its work around open research lines, which may lead to publications, documented prototypes, tools, or methodological materials.

## Example research lines

- **cognitive augmentation and decision support**  
How AI systems can assist complex human processes without reducing autonomy or understanding.
- **responsible AI architectures**  
Technical patterns for auditable, reproducible, and controllable AI systems.
- **human–AI interaction**  
Design of interfaces and workflows that keep humans meaningfully in control.
- **technical documentation and governance**  
Methods to document decisions, risks, assumptions, and limits of AI systems.
- **infrastructure as a public good**  
Reusable and adaptable components for educational and institutional contexts.

Each research line may be in one of the following states: *Exploratory* / *Active* / *In documentation*.
